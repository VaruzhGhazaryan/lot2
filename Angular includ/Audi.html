            AUDI AG is a German company which produces cars under the Audi brand. It is part of the Volkswagen Group.
            The name Audi is based on a Latin translation of the surname of the founder August Horch, itself the German
            word for “listen!" Audi is headquartered in Ingolstadt, Germany.
            On July 16, 1909 automotive pioneer August Horch founded August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH in Germany. A
            short time later he renamed the company after the Latin translation of his last name – making it Audi
            Automobilwerke.
            In 1932, Audi merged with Horch, DKW and Wanderer, to form Auto Union AG. The four rings of the Audi badge
            symbolize the brands Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer. Before World War II, Auto Union AG used the four
            interlinked rings, only on Auto Union racing cars in that period. Member companies used their own names and
            emblems.
            Auto Union GmbH was established in Ingolstadt on September 3rd, 1949 following a series of changes as WWII
            came to an end.
