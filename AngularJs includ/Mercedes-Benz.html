        <h1>Mercedes-Benz</h1>
        <p>
            Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first petrol-powered car, the Benz Patent
            Motorwagen, financed by Bertha Benz[2] and patented in January 1886,[3] and Gottlieb Daimler and engineer
            Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach by the addition of a petrol engine later that year. The
            Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (Daimler Motors Corporation).
            Emil Jellinek, an Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, created the trademark in 1902,
            naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and
            marketing strategist who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society in
            his adopted home, which, at that time, was a meeting place for the "Haute Vol√©e" of France and Europe,
            especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other well-known personalities. But
            Jellinek's plans went further: as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the New World as well,
            including to US billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan and Taylor.
